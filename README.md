# C# Project

This assessment was for an Algorithms Unit in which we needed to design a borrowing system for a library, in which a person may borrow or return a Tool. 
The project was to also allow for users, including a single admin user, and multiple users. 

These two functionalities had limitations, and requirements for storing and searching for information, and tested our knowledge on data structures, and search algorithms, such as Binary search and Heapsort.

Overall, I recieved 95/100 marks for this assessment.
